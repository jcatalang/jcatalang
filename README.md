### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**jcatalang/jcatalang** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

My name is Juan Manuel Catalan and currently I am a researcher in Unsteady Aerodynamics and CFD in the Aerospace Engineering Department at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid. I have a background in Aerospace Engineering (BSc+MSc) and I'm finishing the PhD. I have also several years of experience both in the Aerospace and Wind Energy sectors.
